# CodeForces Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various CodeForces problems. CodeForces is one of the most popular platforms for competitive programming, hosting regular contests and offering a vast problem archive.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by:
- `Contests/` - Solutions to problems from specific contests
  - `Div1/` - Division 1 contest solutions
  - `Div2/` - Division 2 contest solutions
  - `Educational/` - Educational round solutions
- `Problemset/` - Solutions organized by topic/difficulty
  - `Rating-wise/` - Problems grouped by their rating

## Features

- Efficient implementations with explanations
- Problem-solving approach and intuition
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Test cases and edge case handling

## Languages Used

Solutions are primarily implemented in:
- C++
- Python
- Java

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the specific contest or problem rating
2. Each solution file is named with the problem code and name
3. Read the comments to understand the approach
